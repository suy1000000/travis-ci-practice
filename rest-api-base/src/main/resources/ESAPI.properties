#
# DISCUSS: This may cause a major backwards compatibility issue, etc. but
#		   from a name space perspective, we probably should have prefaced
#		   all the property names with ESAPI or at least OWASP. Otherwise
#		   there could be problems is someone loads this properties file into
#		   the System properties.  We could also put this file into the
#		   esapi.jar file (perhaps as a ResourceBundle) and then allow an external
#		   ESAPI properties be defined that would overwrite these defaults.
#		   That keeps the application's properties relatively simple as usually
#		   they will only want to override a few properties. If looks like we
#		   already support multiple override levels of this in the
#		   DefaultSecurityConfiguration class, but I'm suggesting placing the
#		   defaults in the esapi.jar itself. That way, if the jar is signed,
#		   we could detect if those properties had been tampered with. (The
#		   code to check the jar signatures is pretty simple... maybe 70-90 LOC,
#		   but off course there is an execution penalty (similar to the way
#		   that the separate sunjce.jar used to be when a class from it was
#		   first loaded). Thoughts?

# WARNING: Operating system protection should be used to lock down the .esapi
# resources directory and all the files inside and all the directories all the
# way up to the root directory of the file system.  Note that if you are using
# file-based implementations, that some files may need to be read-write as they
# get updated dynamically.
#
# Before using, be sure to update the MasterKey and MasterSalt as described below.
# N.B.: If you had stored data that you have previously encrypted with ESAPI 1.4,
#		you *must* FIRST decrypt it using ESAPI 1.4 and then (if so desired)
#		re-encrypt it with ESAPI 2.0. If you fail to do this, you will NOT be
#		able to decrypt your data with ESAPI 2.0.
#
#		YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! More details are in the ESAPI 2.0 Release Notes.

# ESAPI Configuration
#
# If true, then print all the ESAPI properties set here when they are loaded.
# If false, they are not printed. Useful to reduce output when running JUnit tests.
# If you need to troubleshoot a properties related problem, turning this on may help.
# This is 'false' in the src/test/resources/.esapi version. It is 'true' by
# default for reasons of backward compatibility with earlier ESAPI versions.
ESAPI.printProperties=false

# ESAPI is designed to be easily extensible. You can use the reference implementation
# or implement your own providers to take advantage of your enterprise's security
# infrastructure. The functions in ESAPI are referenced using the ESAPI locator, like:
#
#    String ciphertext =
#		ESAPI.encryptor().encrypt("Secret message");   // Deprecated in 2.0
#    CipherText cipherText =
#		ESAPI.encryptor().encrypt(new PlainText("Secret message")); // Preferred
#
# Below you can specify the classname for the provider that you wish to use in your
# application. The only requirement is that it implement the appropriate ESAPI interface.
# This allows you to switch security implementations in the future without rewriting the
# entire application.
#
# ExperimentalAccessController requires ESAPI-AccessControlPolicy.xml in .esapi directory
ESAPI.Encoder=org.owasp.esapi.reference.DefaultEncoder

#===========================================================================
# ESAPI Encoder
#
# ESAPI canonicalizes input before validation to prevent bypassing filters with encoded attacks.
# Failure to canonicalize input is a very common mistake when implementing validation schemes.
# Canonicalization is automatic when using the ESAPI Validator, but you can also use the
# following code to canonicalize data.
#
#      ESAPI.Encoder().canonicalize( "%22hello world&#x22;" );
#  
# Multiple encoding is when a single encoding format is applied multiple times. Allowing
# multiple encoding is strongly discouraged.
Encoder.AllowMultipleEncoding=false

# Mixed encoding is when multiple different encoding formats are applied, or when 
# multiple formats are nested. Allowing multiple encoding is strongly discouraged.
Encoder.AllowMixedEncoding=false
